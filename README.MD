In my first year during my database course at Nackademin I created this project.
It's a simple shoeshop written in Java with a corresponding database written in MYSQL.
The project requires additional files to be run (a properties-file with account/pw to a MYSQL database), 
I've only left it here on Github as a source of lessons for myself in the future.
